		<title>New Look Website (Finally) Launched!</title>

		<content type="html"><p>After many years of being too busy with client work, then a (very) long stint of ill health, I've finally got my website redesigned. After such a long absense it really does make sense to relaunch from scratch, so I've centered my work around a fun personal site from a domain I managed to snag (which actually includes my name). As I'll be launching several side projects in the coming months, this site will be where they'll appear. My business site will focus purely on my availability for solo work. Enjoy!</p></content>
