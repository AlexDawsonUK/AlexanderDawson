		<title>Christmas Media Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-12-01</updated>
		<id>https://xmasmedia.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>This side project is just a little bit of fun. Because I'm a huge fan of the holidays, and I love nothing more than spending December watching loads of cheesy Christmas movies (and there are LOTS of them), I've highlighted my favourite films and soundtrack for the season. Hope you find some great new stuff to watch here!</p></content>

		<title>Asset Config Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-11-01</updated>
		<id>https://assetconfig.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>There are many tiny but useful files which make up a website. These assets range from plaintext, XML, JSON, and even include images. Including them within your website can improve the user-experience or even your SEO. This tool will generate the code you need (based on your option choices) for your website, ready to drop into an empty document.</p></content>

		<title>Web Sustainability Guidelines Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-09-08</updated>
		<id>https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>The Sustainable Web Design Community Group is a collection of likeminded individuals from a variety of backgrounds with a passion for Sustainability. Our goal has been to establish a set of formal guidelines (similar to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to help end-users, Web workers, stakeholders, educators, and policy makers, improve the environmental footprint of their products and services. After close to two years of collaboration, we have finally published the first public draft of our specification.</p>
		<p>You can learn more about our goals by viewing the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/TPAC_Slides.pdf">presentation</a> we will be giving at the 2023 W3C TPAC conference.</p></content>

		<title>Gratis Library Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-09-01</updated>
		<id>https://gratislibrary.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>Web designers and developers are always giving back to the community. Two methods they do so are through the educational means of providing eBooks and podcasts as a source of learning material and inspiration. Because there are so many great free resources out there, I've taken the time to currate them into a library, exclusively aimed at Web workers.</p></content>

		<title>Semantic Web Hook Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-05-01</updated>
		<id>https://swhook.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>SWHook is a simple, dependency free Microdata JavaScript framework. It turns semantic information embedded within the page into useful functionality for end-users. Once added to a website, this automated library will sniff markup on the fly for compatible microdata and transform it into a useful browser-based format for your visitors. This library adds no bloat, it just enhances what's there on the Semantic Web!</p></content>

		<title>Syntaxonomy Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-04-02</updated>
		<id>https://syntaxonomy.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>The word Syntaxonomy is to bridge a collection (taxonomy) of languages (syntax). In this instance this website is the cumulative assortment of useful links and articles I have found over 20+ years of Web Development. Consider these the must-reads, the insightful philosophies, and the fundamentals. All have been stacked into categories based upon the order you might learn about them through your career.</p></content>

		<title>Printed Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-03-03</updated>
		<id>https://printedcss.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>Print-friendly stylesheets have been around for almost as long as CSS. The idea of making your website look as good on paper as they do on the Web isn't a new idea. It isn't a new idea either to target a printer to ensure your website uses the least amount of paper and ink as possible (removing stuff that isn't required). My new CSS library takes the collective wisdom of previous libraries, extends upon them and provides useful semantic hooks and classes (plus additional new features), to make your pages as eco-friendly as possible.</p></content>

		<title>Website Sustainability Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-02-01</updated>
		<id>https://websitesustainability.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>It's taken me many months of work, but I've finally completed a massive research project examining the carbon impact of W3C web standards like HTML and CSS. This is the first project of its type to go into such depth providing a benchmark for the emissions of a website or app. Hopefully the data will prove useful in web performance and reducing page bloat. Additionally (by request of the W3C Sustainability WG) I've produced a map of variables which showcases carbon traps throughout the websites journey from development to usage.</p></content>

		<title>New Look Website (Finally) Launched!</title>
		<updated>2023-01-28</updated>
		<id>https://alexanderdawson.com/</id>
		<content type="html"><p>After many years of being too busy with client work, then a (very) long stint of ill health, I've finally got my website redesigned. After such a long absense it really does make sense to relaunch from scratch, so I've centered my work around a fun personal site from a domain I managed to snag (which actually includes my name). As I'll be launching several side projects in the coming months, this site will be where they'll appear. My business site will focus purely on my availability for solo work. Enjoy!</p></content>
